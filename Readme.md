# msgCourierLite

## Purpose

msgCourierLite is a lighter version of the msgCourier project.  This version reduces the scope of the project to a core set of functionality.
msgCourier(lite) is a multi-threaded concurrent connection TCP/UDP messaging server (written in C++) for use with custom P2P applications.  It was originally designed for use with the ChessBrain project but development proceeded independently.
